# Avalog

Avalog is a web application written entirely in Ruby on Rails that tracks your work in Avalon labs. It can also be used as a personal diary to keep track of what you've acheived during the day. Use Avalog to:

* Make plans as to what you want to achieve today

* Write down what you actually achieved today after the day ends

* Remind yourself to show up at work

* Have an admin account that tracks all the users' accounts

Cheers to [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) for being so awesome.
